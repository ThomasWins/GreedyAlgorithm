This is my first repository on GitHub, I apologize for the mess in advance. This project solves the problem of finding a greedy and affordable approach to taking n
tomatoes from x pots and splitting them evenly across all x pots. The code is MADE to fail in some cases (showing greediness). Overall the project taught me how greedy
algorithms work and the downsides to trying to achieve a simpler runtime.

Main can be found in TomatoesDriver.java
